College Group Project - Fall 20'

Our group will be analyzing whether NBA players salaries for the 2019-2020 NBA season are correlated to their performance statistics in the 2018-2019 NBA season. 

This data is comprised of 307 players who played for a single team during the 2018-2019 season and signed with one team for the 2019-2020 season.
